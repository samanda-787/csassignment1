## üîÑ BACKUP SCHEMES

### 1. Full Backup
**Execution**: Copies all files and databases every time the backup runs.

**Advantages**:
- Complete backup of all data.
- Easy to restore from a single backup set.

**Disadvantages**:
- Time-consuming and resource-intensive.
- Requires significant storage space.

---

### 2. Incremental Backup
**Execution**: Backs up only files changed since the last incremental backup.

**Advantages**:
- Fast and efficient with minimal storage use.
- Reduces system load during backup.

**Disadvantages**:
- Slower to restore (requires all incremental sets + full backup).
- Slightly more complex to manage.

---

### 3. Differential Backup
**Execution**: Backs up files changed since the last full backup.

**Advantages**:
- Faster restore than incremental (only need full + last differential).
- Requires less space than full backup.

**Disadvantages**:
- More storage than incremental.
- Grows larger until next full backup.

## üéØ PURPOSE OF EACH SCRIPT

### `health_check.sh`
- **Purpose**: Monitor system resource usage and API endpoint availability.

### `backup_api.sh`
- **Purpose**: Create a backup of the API project directory and its database.

### `update_server.sh`
- **Purpose**: Automate system and API code updates from GitHub.
